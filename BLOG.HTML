 <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

      <h2>EL NIDO PALAWAN</h2>
<p> According to CNNGo, El Nido in Palawan is one of the Philippines’ best beaches and island destinations because of its "extraordinary natural splendor and ecosystem." It is frequently called the Philippines' last frontier and is ranked No. 14 among CNN's 100 Best Beaches Around the World. For two years in a row (2016 and 2017), Palawan bagged the No. 1 spot for the "best island in the world" according to the international travel magazine Travel + Leisure. Conde Nast Traveller also listed El Nido as the fourth best beach in the world for 2017.

Forests, Marine Habitats, and Limestone Cliffs
There are about 50 white sand beaches on the island, five types of forests, three major marine habitats, and many different species of birds. The water is also rich in sea life, including: marine mammals like dolphins and dugongs (of which six are endemic); over 100 species of coral; and almost 1,000 different kinds of fish.

El Nido is also the largest marine reserve and sanctuary in the Philippines, with a total area of 903.21 square kilometers. It is one of the most diverse ecosystems in the country, and its flora and fauna are protected. It also has amazing geologic formations such as its limestone cliffs, home of the swiftlets—apodidae birds whose nests are entirely built from threads of their own saliva, an ingredient also used for the famous bird's nest soup.</p>

      <h2>BORACAY AKLAN</h2>
<p> Boracay is a small island 315 km south of Manila in the province of Aklan. Famous for its powdery white sands and pristine blue waters, Boracay is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Philippines. It has over 350 resorts and about 2,000 rooms to accommodate guests, which range from luxury hotels to budget-friendly inns.

Water Sports, Nightlife, and Helmet Diving
This island has something for everyone, from water sports, scuba diving, and snorkeling, to nightlife with great pubs, bars, and restaurants, to a relaxing and tranquil environment.

If you do go scuba diving or snorkeling, you’ll see many species of aquatic life that are indigenous to the Philippines. You could also take the opportunity to go helmet diving, which is where you simply put on a helmet with glass plates, climb a ladder down 10 feet to a (shallow) ocean floor, and walk around as if you were on land.

Important Update: Boracay's rehabilitation is over and it has since been re-opened. The island has new set of strict rules for its visitors to ensure that tourism on the island remains organized and properly handled. It is necessary to check with your travel agency about these rules before going to Boracay.

The White Beach
The best and most famous beach in Boracay is the White Beach, which has been referred to by many as the "finest beach in the world.” In 2012, Boracay Island was named “Best Island in the World” by international travel magazine Travel + Leisure. Puka, on the northern side of Boracay, was also on CNN's 100 Best Beaches Around the World.</p>

      <h2>CORON PALAWAN</h2>
<p> Coron is both the name of an island off the coast of Busuanga and the name of Busuanga’s largest town. Coron Island is inhabited by the Tagbanua people and is a gem of natural beauty, with steep limestone cliffs, white sand beaches, and seven mountain lakes. It's actually been listed among the top 10 best scuba diving sites in the world by Forbes Travel magazine.In addition, behind majestic rock formations, there lies a secret lagoon with crystal blue-green waters encircled with limestone formations and white sand shores. This secret beach is really a paradise! You’ll have to make an effort to get there, however, either by climbing over cliffs or swimming through a sea tunnel. It's totally worth it though!</p>

      <h2>PALAUI ISLAND CAGAYAN VALLEY</h2>
<p> Placing Palaui Island at No. 10 of their Top 100 Best Beaches Around the World list, CNN described it as a raw beauty where nature unfolds with flora and fauna, volcanic rocks, powdery white sands, and rich marine biodiversity.

You won’t find hotels or other luxury items here; it is literally an untouched paradise. If you want to stay, you’ll have to find a homestay or camp on the beach (though camping is now prohibited near the lighthouse).</p>

      <h2>PAGUDPUD ILOCOS NORTE</h2>
<p> Pagudpud, Ilocos Norte is often referred to as the Boracay of the North because of its fine white sands, numerous water activities (for those who are staying at private resorts), and of course crystal blue waters.

Unlike Boracay, however, it is a simple municipality. This is not the place to go for shopping or malls. In fact, there aren’t even any ATMs, so make sure to carry cash with you when you visit the place. Its Blue Lagoon beach is now becoming more famous, but not many tourists go there yet.If you drive to Pagudpud from Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, there are many attractions on the way, such as the Patapat Viaduct and the Bangui Wind Farm. You can also visit the Kabigan Falls and the Kapurpurawan Rock formation.</p>
